# CHALLENGE:
Chef has a sequence A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,…,A<sub>N</sub>. He needs to find the number of pairs (i,j) (1≤i<j≤N) such that A<sub>i</sub>+A<sub>j</sub>=A<sub>i</sub>⋅A<sub>j</sub>. However, he is busy, so he asks for your help.

### Input

 - The first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the
   number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
 - The first line of each test case contains a single integer N.
 - The second line contains N space-separated integers
   A<sub>1</sub>,A<sub>2</sub>,…,A<sub>N</sub>.

### Output
For each test case, print a single line containing one integer ― the desired number of pairs.

### Constraints

 - 1≤T≤20
 - 1≤N≤40,000
 - 0≤A<sub>i</sub>≤10<sup>9</sup> for each valid i
