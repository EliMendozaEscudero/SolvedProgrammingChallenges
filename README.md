# SolvedProgrammingChallenges

## Description:
Just some solved programming challenges.

## Puropose:
I tried to make a set of public problems and personal solutions to be helpful for studying maths and algorithms through the funniest way that I know, solving problems.

## Organitation:
Every folder contains a problem and their original source written in markdown  and a solution in another file.
